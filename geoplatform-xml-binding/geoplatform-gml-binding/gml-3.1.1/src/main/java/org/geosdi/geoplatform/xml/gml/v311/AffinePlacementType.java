/**
 * A placement takes a standard geometric
 *    construction and places it in geographic space. It defines a
 *    transformation from a constructive parameter space to the 
 *    co-ordinate space of the co-ordinate reference system being used.  
 *    Parameter spaces in formulae in this International Standard are 
 *    given as (u, v) in 2D and(u, v, w) in 3D. Co-ordinate reference 
 *    systems positions are given in formulae, in this International 
 *    Standard, by either (x, y) in 2D, or (x, y, z) in 3D.
 * 
 *    Affine placements are defined by linear transformations from 
 *    parameter space to the target co-ordiante space. 2-dimensional 
 *    Cartesian parameter space,(u,v) transforms into 3-dimensional co-
 *    ordinate reference systems,(x,y,z) by using an affine 
 *    transformation,(u,v)->(x,y,z) which is defined :
 * 
 * 	x	ux vx  	x0
 * 			 u	  
 * 	y =	uy vy   + y0
 * 			 v		
 * 	x	uz vz	z0
 * 	
 *    Then, given this equation, the location element of the 
 *    AffinePlacement is the direct position (x0, y0, z0), which is the
 *    target position of the origin in (u, v). The two reference
 *    directions (ux, uy, uz) and (vx, vy, vz) are the target     
 *    directions of the unit vectors at the origin in (u, v).
 *
